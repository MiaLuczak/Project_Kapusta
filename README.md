### Our Task:

Our goal was to test the "Kapu$ta" application and give our opinion about lunching the app in its current state

### My Tasks:

- I participated in the QA Project in *agile Scrum methodology*, as a *Support of our Team Leader* and also a *Tester*
- My duties were testing the Login page of the application, in both aspects of functionality and security of that form, 
as it was a new thing to me I did appropriate research about how Login forms should look and behave
- I was responsible also for the Static review of documentation that was provided to us
- As a Support of our Team Leader, I got a chance to review others' work and provide them a constructive and encouraging feedback,
also I was constantly in touch with our TL and SM
